=============

This package provides the functions related to performing quantitative predictive checks, including:

- underlying calculations:
  - predictive-p value
  - p-equivalence
- plotting output (histograms)

A QPC can be performed on any test statistic, however initial implementation will focus on AUC (area-under-the-curve) and single time-point comparisons.
